# Install v2ray #

To deploy v2ray on CentOS, we use the [installation instruction](https://www.v2ray.com/en/welcome/install.html) on v2ray official site.

run

``` shell
curl -Ls https://install.direct/go.sh | sudo bash
```

and wait the installation process to complete.

# Write the config file #

The v2ray config file is located in `/etc/v2ray/config.json`

Edit the config file

``` shell
nano /etc/v2ray/config.json
```

I prefer using this [v2ray config generator](https://www.veekxt.com/utils/v2ray_gen) to generate config.

Generate one and paste it on your server, and then restart v2ray service

``` shell
systemctl restart v2ray
```

To determine whether v2ray runs correctly, run

``` shell
systemctl status v2ray
```

If on errors occurred, enable v2ray service so that it can start automatically on server startup.

``` shell
systemctl enable v2ray
```

# Firewall configuration #

Allow your port on your server. For CentOS, you may use `firewallcmd`. But I use Alibaba Cloud server. So for me, I use the Alibaba Cloud Console to allow the ports.

Then connect your clients to your server and have fun.
